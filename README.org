#+TITLE: bmee - Basic Mathematical Expressions Evaluator
#+AUTHOR: Pushkar Raj
#+EMAIL: px86@protonmail.com

Reads mathematical expressions from =stdin= and prints the result to =stdout=. It can be used within shell-scripts for shells like =bash=, where floating point arithmetic is not possible. All numbers (integers, floats etc.) are converted to a 64 bit floating point number, so be mindful of precision issues.

* Compilation

Assuming that you have =gnumake= installed and are in the project root.

#+begin_src shell
  make
#+end_src

* Usage

#+begin_src shell
  echo "100*(8-12/2)" | ./bmee
#+end_src

* Note
- It is implemented using a recursive descent parser.
